# Mini-Project-Online-Quiz-App


## Project Overview

This project implements a **console-based Online Quiz Application** developed as part of a Java Developer Internship. The primary objective is to create an interactive quiz experience within the console environment, showcasing fundamental Java programming concepts like control flow, data structures (like Lists), and user input handling.

## Features

*   **Quiz Management:** The application provides a set of pre-defined questions with multiple-choice options.
*   **Interactive Quiz Taking:** Users can select answers for each question presented in the console.
*   **Score Tracking:** The application tracks the user's performance and calculates a final score.
*   **User Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on correct or incorrect answers (optional, based on implementation details not fully specified in the image, but a good practice).

## Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Java
*   **Environment:** Console-based application

## Deliverables

*   **Java Class for Quiz Questions:** A well-structured Java class to define quiz questions and their respective options and correct answers.
*   **Java Class for Results:** A class to manage and display quiz results.
*   **Core Quiz Logic:** Implementation of the quiz flow, including presenting questions, accepting answers, and scoring.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd OnlineQuizApp
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java Files:**
    ```bash
    javac YourMainClass.java # Replace YourMainClass with the name of your main class
    ```
4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    java YourMainClass
    ```

## Hints/Mini Guide (from Internship Task)

1.  Utilize a `List` data structure (e.g., `ArrayList`) to store and manage your quiz questions and their associated options.
2.  Implement logic to accept user input for answers and accurately calculate the user's score based on correct responses.

## Outcome Achieved

This project demonstrates the successful application of Java's control flow mechanisms and logical constructs to create a functional console application, enhancing problem-solving and programming skills.

## Interview Questions (Relevant to this project)

During the internship, understanding concepts related to this project was crucial. Here are some key interview questions explored:

1.  What are Java loops, and how are they used in this application?
2.  Explain the concept of an enhanced `for-loop` in Java.
3.  How did you handle multiple user inputs in this console-based application?
4.  Differentiate between `switch-case` and `if-else` statements in Java, and when would you use each?
5.  What are `Collections` in Java, and how are they useful in this project?
6.  Specifically, what is an `ArrayList`, and why might it be a suitable choice for storing quiz questions?
